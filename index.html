      <h2>What Are Crabs?</h2>
      <p>
        Crabs are Crustaceans that live in bodies of oceanwater, freshwater or on land, They belong under the Infraorder
        Brachyura,
        which in short tail in greek, meaning they crabs have tails. Crabs are generally cover with a thick exoskeleton
        made from chitin,
        which is used in the exoskeleton of insects as well. They grow by molding their shells as the shell does not
        change in size, so periodically the
        shed the shell to make brand new bigger shells to fit them as they grow, like clothes for us when we grow older.

        They also have a pair of pincers that are used to hunt for food or defend themselves from predators.

      <h1>How Crabs are in the wild?</h1>
      <p>
        In the wild, crabs exhibit a wide range of behaviors and interactions with their environment.
        Their specific behavior and lifestyle can vary depending on the species of crab and the type of habitat they
        inhabit,
        whether it's marine (saltwater) or freshwater environments. Here are some common characteristics and behaviors
        of crabs in the wild:
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Foraging</h2>
      <div class="box">
      <img src="images/crabforaging.jpg" alt="crab hunting">
    </div>
      <p>
        Crabs use their pincers to forage or hunt for food, their pincers grab onto anything that is within range and
        applies force onto
        the target. Some just grab their prey and start consumption while others use their crushing claw to break the
        shell or bones to feast
        onto the soft meat.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Burrowing and Molting</h2>
      <div class="align">

        <img src="images/molt_series_SG.jpg" alt="crab molting">
        <img src="images/burrowing.jpg" alt="crab molting">

      </div>

      <p>
        Crabs require molting as since they are Crustaceans, they are unable to grow their shell as it is made from non
        organic matter that is hard to break,
        so it has to molt away its old shell and make a new one that is bigger for it to grow. After it finishes the
        molting process, it is at its weakest as the
        shell of the newly molted crab has not hardened yet, making it soft and easy prey to predators, this is why
        crabs burrow underground.
        Crabs burrow underground as a defense mechanism to hide from predators or ambush unsuspecting prey, they are
        able to burrow underground by using their
        hindlegs and claws to dig the sand or ground out and pull themselves deeper into the substrate.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Male Crab engage in various courtship behaviors to attract female mates.
        These courtship displays can include waving their claws, performing dance-like
        movements, producing sounds, or releasing pheromones.

              Infraorder, they will always have
              a very short abdomen and 10 legs.
              False Crabs on the order hand has belongs under the Anomuran Infraorder, they have a longer abdominal
              section with fewer walking legs compared to the true ones.

              Crabs are omnivorous creatures, in the wild their diet consists of small fish, algae and other crabs.
              However, in captivity crabs can eat numerous food that
              we humans eat, like vegetables, meat and fruits. They can also eat snacks like chips but it's not
              recommanded as it lacks nutrients and is generally unhealthy for us or them.

              Crabs have the ability to regenerate missing limbs. They first store up a ton of energy within their body,
              then they expand it out to during the molding process to regrow their limbs, this spans across multiple
              molting
              section and it will not be exactly the same as the original limb. It is also only found in certain species
              of crab so not all crabs have this healing factor.
